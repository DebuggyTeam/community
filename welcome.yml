    Listen to & respect all community team members: >
      Please take requests from community team members seriously and listen when a team member asks you to do
      something. If you have a problem with what a team member is asking you to do, we advise that you step away from
      the situation and send a private message to another team member.
    Keep all projects legal, legitimate & appropriate: >
      We will not tolerate any projects that may break laws, breach a Terms of Service or an EULA, involve sexual
      content, or that the moderators determine to be malicious or inappropriate.

      You must help us to help you, and it's important that you include as much information as you can with your help
      request. We also recommend creating a thread for your help request, with your mappings in the thread name
      (`MCP`, `MM`, `YM` or `QM`).

      One of our most important rules - don't make things difficult for other users by bringing up controversies from
