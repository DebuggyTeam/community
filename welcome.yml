      description: >-
        We are a group of people who like making Minecraft mods. You can find info about our projects below:
        <#1026251656029011978>: expansive biome mod.
        <#1026272355951058974>: A mod that adds in a sawmill for cutting any wood-based blocks.
        
        
        Now for some backstory on how Debuggy Community formed: In mid June of 2022, woodiertexas was wanting to put together a modding team and
        as a result, he needed a name. Since Architecture Extensions adds an easter egg block titled "Oddly Colored Block" with a blockID of
        `debuggy_block`, woodie chose to call the modding team "Debuggy Team".
        
        
        The "Oddly Colored Block" added by Arch-Ex uses the "[debug1](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/History_of_textures/Unused_textures#debug.png_and_debug2.png)" texture found in Minecraft's game files.
